# Core
This contains the core microservice in charge of handling authentication, and
user resource.

## Connecting
Any other microservice which needs to be authenticated will use the same
public key for decryption.

## TODO
1. Setup Redis table
2. Setup Notifications table
3. Setup Docker with docker compose
